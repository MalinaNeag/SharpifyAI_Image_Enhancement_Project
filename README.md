# SharpifyAI — Modular AI Image Enhancement
![SharpifyAI Preview](image-enhancement-frontend/src/resources/preview.jpg)

## 💡 What is SharpifyAI?

**SharpifyAI** is a full-stack web application designed to enhance low-quality images by applying AI super-resolution techniques **selectively** across distinct image regions: faces, backgrounds, and text.

Unlike traditional tools that apply a uniform model to the whole image, SharpifyAI performs **semantic segmentation** to isolate and enhance each region using a **dedicated model**:

- 🧑‍🦰 `GFPGAN` for facial restoration
- 🌄 `Real-ESRGAN` for background enhancement
- 🔤 `TextBSR` for improving text clarity

Built using **React (frontend)**, **Flask (backend)**, **Firebase Authentication**, **AWS S3**, and integrated with **Gradio/Colab** for GPU-powered AI inference.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🖼️ Upload images and choose which regions to enhance (face / background / text)
- 🔍 Compare original vs enhanced results directly in-browser
- 📥 Download final high-resolution outputs
- 📱 Full support for desktop and mobile interfaces
- 📊 Evaluated with PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, ΔE₀₀, OCR confidence, and more

## ⚙️ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 🧠 Step 1: Run the Colab Notebook

1. Open `SharpifyAI.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all cells (GPU must be enabled)
3. Copy the generated Gradio URL generated by the last cell (e.g., https://xxxx.gradio.live)
4. Paste it into both `.env` files as `GRADIO_URL`

### 📂 Step 2: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MalinaNeag/SharpifyAI_Image_Enhancement_Project.git
cd SharpifyAI_Image_Enhancement_Project
```

### 🌍 Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables

Create two `.env` files: one in `image-enhancement-frontend/` and one in `image-enhancement-backend/`.

#### Frontend `.env`

```env
# Firebase
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=

# Backend & Gradio
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000
REACT_APP_GRADIO_URL=https://your-gradio-link.gradio.live

# AWS
REACT_APP_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
REACT_APP_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_REGION=
```

####  Backend `.env`

```env
# Flask security key
FLASK_SECRET_KEY=

# Google OAuth2 credentials (from Google Cloud Console)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://127.0.0.1:5000/login/callback

# Firebase API key (can match frontend key)
FIREBASE_API_KEY=

# AWS credentials (from AWS IAM)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=
AWS_REGION=

# Gradio URL from Colab
GRADIO_URL=https://your-gradio-link.gradio.live
```

#### 🔑 Where to Get These Credentials

- Firebase → https://console.firebase.google.com → Project Settings → Web App
- Google OAuth → https://console.cloud.google.com → Credentials → OAuth 2.0
- AWS IAM & S3 → https://aws.amazon.com → IAM + S3 bucket
- Gradio → Generated from the Colab notebook

### 🚀 Step 4: Run the Backend

```bash
cd image-enhancement-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

### 🚀 Step 5: Run the Frontend

In a separate terminal:

```bash
cd image-enhancement-frontend
npm install
npm run start
```

## 📱 Mobile Support

This application is fully responsive and supports both desktop and mobile interfaces.
